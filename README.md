This is a very basic example of using cucumber-js within a node module.

    npm install-test

Please note the use of `cucumber.cjs`: a common-js configuration file for cucumber.
This is a [current limitation of cucumber-js esm support](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/main/docs/esm.md).
